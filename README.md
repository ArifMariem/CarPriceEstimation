# Tunisian Car Price Estimation

## Overview

This project focuses on building a car price estimation tool for Tunisian cars using pre-scraped data from various car dealership websites. By employing machine learning models, we aim to predict car prices based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, and additional specifications. The existing dataset has already been collected but not cleaned. 

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Perform in-depth analysis on the pre-scraped dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and distributions of car features and prices.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensure the dataset is ready for training by handling any remaining missing values, outliers, and other preprocessing tasks.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Develop and train machine learning models to accurately estimate car prices based on various features.


## Technologies

- **Python:** Utilize Python for data analysis, machine learning model development, and web interface implementation.

- **Pandas and NumPy:** Leverage these libraries for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.

- **Scikit-Learn:** Implement and train machine learning models for price estimation.


## Usage

1. **Data Analysis and Processing:** Execute scripts to analyze the existing dataset, handle any remaining preprocessing tasks, and ensure data readiness.

2. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data to predict car prices accurately.
